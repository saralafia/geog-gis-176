# Geography 176A: Intro to GIS (Summer 2017)
Instructor: Sara Lafia, Department of Geography, UC Santa Barbara

## About
This course is a comprehensive overview of Geographic Information Systems and Science. Geographic information systems are used to build interactive queries, assess spatial information, edit map data, and share the results of analyses with an audience. The topics covered in this course span the nature of geographic information science and the procedures for operating GIS.

## Objectives
By the completion of the course, you will be able to:

* Describe and map the location of anything, using spatial reference systems and
their implementations in GIS;
* Identify, characterize, and produce four types of geographic information (field, object, network, and event);
* Identify and characterize the two main quality criteria of geographic information (granularity and accuracy);
* Critically assess how geographic information is used in society at large.
